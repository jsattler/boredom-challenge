# Boredom Challenge

A minimalist timer app that helps you practice being bored. Set a timer, sit with your boredom, and build a daily streak.

The app randomly checks if you're still there during your session. If you don't respond in time, the session doesn't count. When the timer ends, you confirm whether you actually stayed bored - only honest completions count toward your streak.

All your data stays in your browser. Export and import your sessions whenever you need to.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
